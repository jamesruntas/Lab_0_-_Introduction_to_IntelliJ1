    <h1>Lab 0 - Introduction to IntelliJ</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
<!--    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>-->
    <h3>~2.0 Lab Problem~</h3>
    <p>
        You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
        <strong>
            YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
            HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
        </strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to complete the problem in this environment, the files can be
        retrieved by right-clicking '2.0 Lab Problem'>Show in Files/Explorer.
    </p>
    <h3>~Problem 2.1~</h3>
    <p>
        Submit <strong>Problem.java</strong> when you are done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every lab will be closed off with a final problem designed to test your understanding of the material. You will
        be required to submit your file(s) on CuLearn.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Make sure to follow these guidelines for every submission:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The files must be in the specified format(s) with the specified name(s).</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Every file must include your name and student number at the top.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Code must compile and run.</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For this lab problem, you are going to combine everything we have covered so far to create your very first
        Java program (in this course). Feel free to do this problem and future ones outside of EduTools, or even
        IntelliJ. All that is needed at the end is(are) your file(s) with complete solutions.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a file called <code>Problem.java</code> under this task (right click on '2.1'>New>Java Class).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the <code>main()</code> method. Remember this is the starting point of our program, and for our
            purposes, it always looks the same!
            <div class="hint">
                Inside of <code>Problem.java</code>, you can type 'main' and hit the Tab key for a neat shortcut.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Print out your name and student number!
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        That is it! Now just submit your course files on CuLearn. <strong>Remember your name and
        student number in comments at the top of every file!</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="hint">
        If you are struggling, refer back to the video on CuLearn that provides a walkthrough of this lab.
