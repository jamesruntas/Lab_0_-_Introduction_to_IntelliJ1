    <h1>Lab 0 - Introduction to IntelliJ</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <!--    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>-->
    <h3>~1.0 Overview~</h3>
    <p>
        You should use this lab to familiarize yourself with the IntelliJ EduTools environment. It is the environment in
        which labs will be delivered. EduTools allows for feedback and help with your solution. A walkthrough of this
        lab is posted on CuLearn.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.2~</h3>
    <p>
        Other tasks will require you to validate your code against the correct output.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this task, you are being asked to print out "OOP!". You should edit the required files by adding your code
        in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every task has its own isolated <code>src</code> folder. Although it is not visible to you within EduTools, it
        is there. You can add and remove files from this folder by right clicking the task and selecting a new Java
        class (1.2>New>Java Class).
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Main.java</code> is the point from which our code is run, because it contains the <code>main()</code>
        method. This is all you need to understand for now, but there will be more to come soon.
    </p>
    <div class="hint">
        You can click on 'Check' and then on 'Compare Outputs' to bring up a window that you can use to debug your
        code.
